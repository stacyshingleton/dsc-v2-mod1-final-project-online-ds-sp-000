# Module 1 Final Project

## Stacy Shingleton

### Objective:

Import, clean and analyze data from *kc_house_data.csv* to ultimately generate a multivariate linear regression that will accurately predict home sale prices.

### The dataset 

*kc_house_data.csv* is a data set that contains home sale prices from King County, Washington state, between May 2014 and May 2015. The dataset contains values which further describe each home sold, seperated into columns that are defined within the *column_names.md* file.

### Deliverables:

1. A Jupyter notebook, *ModuleOneProject.ipynb*, containing all code used for the project, including comments that explain each block of code
2. A slide presentation, *presentation.pdf*, created for non-technical stake holders to descibe the process and results of the project
3. A video walkthrough of the non-technical slide presentation
4. A technical blog post describing the steps and outcome of the project, *https://medium.com/@stacyshingleton/king-county-house-sales-a524bc0e5cf*
